# Plater mod for Total RP 3 Nameplates

This is just an archival repo to store these files so they can be easily viewed outside of the game. You shouldn't be concerned with functionality here as there's a lot of stuff that happens on the backend within Plater.

Each file here represents a "hook", basically an event listener, within the mod. This does not contain any of the metadata for the mod such as the version, author, options, etc.
